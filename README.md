# Screenshot Tool
A Unity tool to help create icons and screenshots.

## How to use
- Drag the project folder into your Unity assets and open up the 'Screenshot' scene.
- A camera rig object and demo scene has already been set up.
- The camera rig allows you to edit the position, rotation and framing of the camera, as well as the Scene's Lighting & Render Settings. Once you are done you can hit the 'Take Screenshot' button and it will be saved to your assets folder.

For icons, I recommend disabling the skybox and setting the background colour to something easy to remove in image editing software.

Requires the Editor Coroutines package!
