Lets you take in-editor captures of the game view at full resolution - use to help make icons, renders or demo screenshots.

## How to use
- Drag the assets folder into your project folder.
- Open up the demo scene.
- The camera rig object allows you to edit the framing of the camera, as well as the scene's Lighting & Render Settings.
- Build your scene and use the settings to frame your shot. If it is a large scene, you can move the camera rig's transform to change the origin of the camera's focus.
-  When finished, hit the button on the camera rig to save the shot.

For icons, disable the skybox and set the background colour to something easy to key out in image editing software.

Requires the Editor Coroutines package!
